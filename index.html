    Layouts of d3
    </h1>
<p>
    In fact, I feel like they share a lot of similarities with both the circles and the path we have learnt. Why? Because the key is the same, which is applying the data to some sorts of visualization by using d3. The process of creating the visualization is also similar. The format is similar- they are all inserting something into the svg; they all require us to bind the data, and they all require us to make the presentation beautiful. The difference is only in how the designers want to present the data, and there are many ways.
